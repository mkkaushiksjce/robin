The electromagnetics simulation platform. I passed engineering electromagnetics with difficulty but when I read articles on electromagnetism I started realizing it is used by everyone in thier day to day life. Even birds like 
robins use it for navigation. This will be a platform for industry professionals and students for electromagnetic simulations. Don't read just create a simulation, and get your hands dirty.
